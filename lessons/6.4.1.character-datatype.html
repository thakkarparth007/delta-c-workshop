<h1>The character datatype - char</h1>

<pre>

The character datatype is somewhat special. One can use it 
like integers! In fact, if you had examined the previous chart
charfully <em>(sic!)</em>, you'd have noticed that the ctype 
functions <em>toupper</em> and <em>tolower</em> return an integer,
whereas, the explanation says that they return uppercase and 
lowercase characters.

The reason for this is - ASCII.
