<b>Standard Library</b>

C provides a large number of functions for you to use. 
They are not a part of the language as such, but they're
a part of the Standard Library of C. Every programming language 
comes with a lot of prewritten code, so that coding in that 
language becomes easier. Such code is called the Standard Library
of the language.

<b>Header files</b>

The standard library of C is vast. Thousands of lines of code,
if not millions. C provides a way to organize such a high magnitude 
of code via <em>Header Files</em>.
