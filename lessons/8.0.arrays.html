<h1>Arrays</h1>

<div>
	<pre>

Syntax:

	<em>&lt;data-type&gt;</em> <em>&lt;variable-name&gt;</em><b>[ <em>&lt;size&gt;</em> <b> ]; </b>

Example:
	
	<b>int my_awesome_array[69];</b>

This creates an array of 69 integers.

Think of arrays as how a group of related numbers are written in maths:
<em> n<sub>1</sub>, n<sub>2</sub>, n<sub>3</sub>, ... </em>

The numbers at the bottom of each <em>n</em> is called the subscript.
So, n<sub>1</sub> is the 1st n, n<sub>2</sub> is the 2nd n etc.

In computers, the subscripts are called indexes. And they start from 0,
and not from 1, as is the convention in maths.

What you'd write as n<sub>2</sub> in maths, would be written as n[2]
(being careful about the 0-based index).
