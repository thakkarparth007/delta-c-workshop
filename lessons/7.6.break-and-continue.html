<h1>The break and the continue statements</h1>

<div>
	<pre>

Consider the problem of checking if a number is prime or not.
The way you'd have done is this - you go through all numbers from 
1 to n, and then count the number of factors of the number in 
question, and then at the end of the loop, check if the number 
of factors is two.

That's valid. However, there is a better way. You start from <em>i = 2</em>, 
and check if <em>i</em> divides the number in question <em>n</em>. Instead
of looping through all the numbers from 1 to n, you can simply stop the loop
whenever you encounter the first factor of n. Why? Because that would mean
that we've found a factor of n, and that means that n isn't prime!

How to do this? Using the break statement:
