<h1>Variables</h1>

<div>
	<pre>
All data of the program is stored in memory as "variables". 
The most basic form of computation is adding/multiplying two numbers.

This is how you tell the program the existence of a variable:

	<b><em>[data type] [name];</b> </em>

Integers in C language have the type <b><em>int</em></b>

So:
int a;

You can assign values like this:

int a = 5;     // Assign as you declare, a good practice. [This is a single line comment]
    [or]
int a;		  // Declare 
a = 5;		  // Then assign. No big issues.

There are several other standard data types and also user-defined data types. 
You will learn as we move on.
