<h1>Day 1 : Homework</h1>

<div>
	<pre>
The following questions are based on what was already covered today:
(The questions are in order of increasing difficulty.)

	<hr>
1. <b>Barcode verifier</b>
	A barcode has 13 digits. The first twelve digits represent 
	the actual information about the product, where as the last digit
	acts as a check digit. (Barcodes are generally scanned by machines,
	and there is a good chance that the scanning might not be accurate,
	hence, the last digit is used as a checker.)

	To check if the scanned barcode is correct, you do the following:

	Add all the digits in the odd position (except the last digit). 
	Multiply this sum by 3,	and to it, add the sum of all digits in the 
	even position. Subtract one from this. Take modulo 10 of the remaining
	value. Subtract the result from 9. The last digit must be equal to 
	this.

	Your task is - given a barcode (13 digits, space separated), 
	output "VALID" if the barcode is valid. Output "INVALID" otherwise.

	(Modulo means remainder. "Take modulo 10 of x" means, find the remainder
	that x would leave when divided by 10. You use the <b>%</b> operator
	for finding the remainder. The result of <b>11 % 3</b> is 2, because 
	11 leaves 2 as the remainder on division by 3.

	People who know loops and arrays, I'd recommend that you write both
	versions of this code - one using loops &amp; arrays, and the other
	without using them. You would be surprised that the latter is shorter.
	Not a big thing, really. Just saying.)

	<hr>
2. <b>Armstrong Number</b>
	Look up what an Armstrong number is, on Google, in case you don't
	already know. 

	Your task is this - given a 3 digit number, output "YES" if the 
	number is an Armstrong number. Output "NO" otherwise.

	(
	<em>Hint</em>: To extract the digit in ten's place of a number, you may 
	do this: 
		<b>(mynumber / 10) % 10</b>
	)

	<hr>
3. <b>Time conversion</b>
	You are to write a program that converts between the 24 hour format time
	and 12 hour format time. So, as an input, you take two numbers,
		hh:mm
	and also a number, which indicates that the user wants to convert 
	from 12 hour format to 24 hour format, or vice versa (use it the way
	we used the "shape" variable in the rectangle-triangle area program).

	It would be nice if you could also check if the input is invalid. 
	That is, the user might enter 13:59 and ask you to convert from 
	12 hour to 24 hour format, however 13:59 is itself in 24 hour format.


	<hr>
4. <b>Date verifier</b>
	As I had said in the session, you are to write a program that checks if
	the given date is valid. I want you to check all corner cases. So,
	for example, your program must be able to handle cases like
		29 2 2015
	The program must mark this as invalid. 

	<b>Note:</b>Leap years aren't just years divisible by 4! If a year 
	is a century year (divisible by 100), then it must also be divisible
	by 400. So, 1900 isn't a leap year. But 2000 is.
