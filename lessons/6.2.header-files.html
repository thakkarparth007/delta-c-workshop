<h1>Header files</h1>

<pre>

Basically, the header files contain the functions of similar category 
<em>(this is not completely true. We are lying. But. For now, think of 
it that way)</em>. For example, all the IO (input/output) related code 
is written in the <b>stdio.h</b> file. All the maths-related code is 
written in the <b>math.h</b> file. All the character-manipulation code 
is written in the <b>ctype.h</b> (c-type means character-type).

To use a particular function, you must <em>include</em> the header file 
containing that function. That's what the <b>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</b>
was for at the top of each program of yours. That file contains 
the code for the <em>printf</em> function.

There are many such header files. We will look at some of them one 
by one.
