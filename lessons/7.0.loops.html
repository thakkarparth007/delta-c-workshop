<h1>Loops</h1>

<pre>

Often programs need to do something repeatedly. For example,
to find the sum of first hundred natural numbers, one could 
manually type "1+2+3+...+100". In such cases, it is possible 
to manually write down a long list of instructions - though 
one wouldn't prefer to do that, obviously.

However, there are many cases in which, one doesn't exactly know
till when, or how many times, you want to execute a set of 
instructions. In such cases, it is not even possible to write 
down the instructions manually.

For such things, we use <em>loops</em>.
