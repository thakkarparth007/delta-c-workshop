<h1>If statement</h1>
<div>
	<pre>
The 'if' statement is a conditional statement. This means that we provide a condition
to the statement (like penguins_are_awesome == 1 or x > y) and if and only if the condition is
satisfied, the block of code below the if statement is executed.

There are a number of comparison operators one can use in if statements. Two of them, equality
and greater than, were used above.

				&lt;

			<td>
				Greater than or equals
			</td>
			<td>
				&gt;=
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				Lesser than or equals
			</td>
			<td>
				&lt;=
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				Does not equal
			</td>
			<td>
				!=
			</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
</div>
<pre>
There also exists an else statement, which must follow an if statement. If the
condition in the if statement does not evaluate to true, the else block gets executed.
We can also have an 'else if' block, wherein we specify another condition for the else if block.
