<h1>Logical Operators</h1>
<pre>
Apart from the comparison operators, which are used for mathematical comparisons,
there exist logical operators (like penguins_are_awesome == 1 &amp;&amp; penguins_suck == 0).
'And', 'or' and 'not' are logical operators. If you only want your if block to execute if two
statements are true simultaneously, use 'and'. The example above uses 'and' - the block below the
if statement will execute if and only if penguins_are_awesome is one and penguins_suck is zero.
Just like comparison operators, logical operators also have symbols of their own.
