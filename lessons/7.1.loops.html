<h1>Loops!</h1>

<pre>
	
Loop is a programming construct with which one can 
execute a set of instructions repeatedly.

There are 3 types of loops in C (and in most other languages).

	1. while loop
	2. do-while loop
	3. for loop

The while loop is the simplest of the all. But the others are simple too!

Whatever can be done using one type of loop, can be done using the other 
type of loop. Which loop to use depends upon the type of task at hand.
