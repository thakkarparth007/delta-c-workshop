<h1>The <em> float </em> data type</h1>

<div>
	<pre>
This is one of the most common mistakes in C beginners.
They forget about <em>integer approximation.</em>

When you declare a variable as <em>int</em> we tell the program that it stores only integral values

Now, (25*35)/2 is not an integer. It has digits following the decimal point. 
If the variable is an <em>int</em>, those digits are ignored. 
<b><em> Data loss! </em></b>
Use:
1. Type casting
2. Use a higher data type than <em>int</em> -> <em>A float</em> [You just learnt a new data type]
	</pre>
</div>
