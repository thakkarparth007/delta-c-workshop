<h1>Homework for Day 2</h1>

<hr>

<pre>

Before the homework, we'd like to have a review of the first 
two days. Please fill <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/DyK0GTCVl2">this feedback form</a> if you already haven't.

<hr>

1. <b>Maximum of a list</b>: <em>[ Easy ]</em>
	
	Write a program to find the largest of a series of numbers. The program must prompt the user to enter the numbers one by one. When the user enters 0 or a negative number, the program must display the largest non negative number entered.
	(Hint: while loop)

2. <b>Third largest of a list</b>:  <em>[ Slightly Tricky ]</em>

	Write the same program, but instead of printing the largest, print the third largest. Assume that the input has at least 3 numbers.

3. <b>GCD</b>:  <em>[ Moderate ]</em>

	Write a program that prints the GCD of two numbers.

	(Hint: Use Euclid's algorithm.
	Let <em>m</em> and <em>n</em> be two numbers. If <em>n</em> is 0, then stop. <em>m</em> contains the GCD. Otherwise, compute the remainder when <em>m</em> is divided by <em>n</em>. Copy <em>n</em> into <em>m</em> and copy the remainder into <em>n</em>. Then repeat the process, starting wih testing whether <em>n</em> is 0.)

3.1 <b>Fraction adder</b>: <em>[ Easy if you could do problem 3 ]</em>

	This is a a small extension to the previous problem. Write a program that takes input as 2 fractions, and you are to print the sum of the two fractions - taking care that you print the fraction in its lowest terms (that is, for 8/16, you should print 1/2)

4. <b>Calender printer</b>:  <em>[ Moderate ]</em>

	Write a program that prints a one-month calender. The user specifies the number of days in the month and the day of the week on which the month begins.

	For example:

	<div style="border: 1">
		Enter the number of days in month: 31
		Enter starting day of the week (1=Sun, 7=Sat): 3

		       1  2  3  4  5
		 6  7  8 10 11 12 13
		13 14 15 16 17 18 19
		20 21 22 23 24 25 26
		27 28 29 30 31
	</div>

	Hint: This program isn't as hard as it looks. The most important part is a for statement that uses a variable i to count from 1 to n, where n is the number of days in the month, printing each value of i. Inside the loop, an if statement tests whether i is the last day in a week; if so, it prints a new line character.

5. <b>Number of days between two dates</b> <em>[ Annoyingly tricky ]</em>:

	Write a program, that reads two dates as input, and prints the number of days between the two dates. Take care to deal with leap years.

6. <b>Finding the line of best fit</b> <em>[ Fun problem, but easy ]</em>:

	While conducting an experiment, one often has to draw graphs. Consider such a typical case, where you have some data points, and you are to plot a graph. However, this situtation is different. In school experiments, you'd be knowing the relation between the quantities on x and y axes before hand. For example, in an experiment to verify Ohm's law, you'd be knowing before hand that <b>V = IR</b>. In most real experiments, you wouldn't be knowing the relation before hand. Also, unlike school, you can't manipulate your observations to the "correct" values. There are no correct values.

	In such case, what is usually done is, the data points are marked on the graph sheet, and a curve is drawn such that it seems to make sense of the data. This process is called curve-fitting. 

	Your task is to tackle a smaller version of curve-fitting - you are to find the line of best fit - the line that best matches the data points. The input is n pairs of numbers (can be non-integers too), and your output must be the equation of the line.

	<a href="http://hotmath.com/hotmath_help/topics/line-of-best-fit.html">Look at this page</a>. The page describes how to calculate the line. (This isn't the only method used to calculate this btw.)

	The program is extremely simple once you know the formula, of course. The point of giving this program was just give something light-weight and fun and insightful.

7. <b>John Convey's "look and say" sequence</b> <em>[ Difficult ]</em>

	Have a look at what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look-and-say_sequence">wikipedia</a> has to say about the "Look and Say Sequence".

	Your task is to write a program to print first n terms of this sequence.
