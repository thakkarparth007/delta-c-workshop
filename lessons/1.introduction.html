Every computing machine is made amazing by Software.
Software is beautiful.

We use software everyday and it has changed our lives.

Programming is all about manipulating data in the memory effectively and accurately.
Basically, it is a way of communicating with your computer.
And for communication, we need a language. 
Just like there are so many languages in the world, there are so many programming languages.
