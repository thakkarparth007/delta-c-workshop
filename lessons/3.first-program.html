<h1>First program - a pun</h1>

<div>
	<pre>
		This is your first C program! 
		(What the hell is all this?!) 

		The first lines are comments. What are comments? Why are they there?

		The next line after this is the "#include ..." 
		Ask us what it is. :P

		Next is "int main()" which is the starting point of all C programs. 
		Closely look at the open and close braces. We are now entering a block!

		What is "printf(..."? 
		Did you notice that most of the statements in this language terminate with a ';'?

		Finally we have a "return 0;" You will learn about it in functions.
