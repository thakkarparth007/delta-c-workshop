<h1>Functions - Introduction</h1>

<div>
	<pre>

Functions in C, or any other programming languages, are essentially
like functions in maths. Functions in maths take some parameters/arguments 
and return a value. In programming, that is generalized a bit more. 
Here, the functions are things that take some arguments/parameters, 
carry out some steps, and return a value. 

You can think of this as a "mini program" - since, as we said before,
a program is something that takes an input, executes some instructions,
and returns some output.

Right now, we will not learn how to write our own functions. Here, we 
will just show how to use some existing functions.
