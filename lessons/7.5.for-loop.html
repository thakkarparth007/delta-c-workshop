<h1>The for loop</h1>

<div>
	<pre>

The for loop has the following structure:

	<b>for (</b> <em>&lt;some assignments&gt;</em> <b>;</b> <em>&lt;loop condition&gt;</em> <b>;</b> <em>&lt;loop variable increment&gt;</em> <b>)</b>
	{
		<em>&lt;statements 1&gt;</em>
		<em>&lt;statements 2&gt;</em>
			.
			.
			.
	}

This type of loop is typically used for executing some code repeatedly, when 
you know how many times you will be executing those statements.  

How the loop works is this:
1. When you "are about to enter" the loop, the <em>&lt;some assignments&gt;</em> above 
gets executed.
2. After that is done, the computer checks the <em>&lt;loop condition&gt;</em>.
3. If the condition is true, then the statements in the <em>body</em> of the loop
are executed, one by one.
4. Once that is done, the <em>&lt;loop variable increment&gt;</em> part is executed.
5. Go to step 2.

The while loop and the do while loop are typically used when you want to execute 
something repeatedly, till a certain condition is true.

You can obviously use the for and while/do-while loops in a different manner, 
but then that's not recommended.
